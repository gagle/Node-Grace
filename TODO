- Try to remove the express error handler and put it internally right before
  start listening the socket.

- Fails using mongoose, thrown exceptions are captured in the default error
  handler when they should go to the request error handler

- restart event

- restart() function
	Gracefully restarts
	
	Examples:
	
		On the master:
		
		restart({ code: 200, delay: 2000 }):
			kill workers and master
			master exit code 200
			restarts after 2000ms
		restart():
			restart workers in parallel, all the workers are killed and then started
			no exit code, therefore master is not killed
			no delay
		restart({ min: 2, delay: 1000 })
			kill workers but maintain always 2 active workers while restarting them
			e.g. 4 workers: a, b, c, d.
				kill a
				kill b
				start a
				kill c
				start b
				kill d
				start c
				start d
			each worker is restarted after 1000ms
		
		On the worker:
		
		restart({ code: 100 }):
			kill worker with exit code 100
			no delay
