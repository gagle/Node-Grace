restart()
	Gracefully restarts
	
	Examples:
	
		On the master:
		
		restart({ code: 200 }):
			kill workers and master
			master exit code 200
		restart():
			restart workers in parallel, all the workers are killed and then started
			no exit code, therefore master is not killed
		restart({ min: 2 })
			kill workers but maintain always 2 active workers while restarting them
			e.g. 4 workers: a, b, c, d.
				kill a
				kill b
				start a
				kill c
				start b
				kill d
				start c
				start d
		
		On the worker:
		
		restart(100):
			kill worker with exit code 100
